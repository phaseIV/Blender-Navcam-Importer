## Introduction
For autonomous driving on Mars every rover is equipped with a set of (Left and Right) Navigation camera's. From the photo's made with these camera's a depth map is computed which is used by the rover to avoid collisions with rocks or other obstacles. These depth maps, which are basically digitized Martian landscapes, get transmitted back to earth with all other obtained data and after a four month period they appear online in the [Planetary Data System Imaging](http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov) archive from NASA.
 
The Navcam-importer addon is able to locate and decode the depth maps and import them into Blender. The only thing required is the filename of a valid Left Navcam image to retrieve the corresponding data from the NASA/PDS archive. Example filenames are:  
- for Spirit:        2Nxxxx, 2Pxxxx, 2Fxxxx, 2Rxxxx (Navcam Pancam, Front hazcam, Rear hazcam)   - Example: 2N227484705MRDAS2JP1981L0M1
- for Opportunity:   1Nxxxx, 1Pxxxx, 1Fxxxx, 1Rxxxx (Navcam Pancam, Front hazcam, Rear hazcam)   - Example: 1N142657823MRD3221P1971L0M1
- for Curiosity:     NLB_499684210EDR_F0501222NCAM00290M_

What script actually reads of name  2N227484705MRDAS2JP1981L0M1 is (reference: https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/data/mer/opportunity/mer1ho_0xxx/document/CAMSIS_latest.PDF )
 - **2N or 1N: Identify rover**
 - **227484705: Spacecraft clock string, used to determine sol**
 - MRD: product type (ignored)
 - AS: site number (ignored)
 - 2J: drive number (ignored)
 - **P: "P" means  image from any camera (Navcam Pancam or Hazcam)**
 - **1981: unique identifier of sequence**
 - L: left (ignored; texture is always taken from left image)
 - 0: filter number (ignored)
 - M: image author (Nasa MIPS; ignored)
 - 1: image version (ignored)

Do NOT include final .img or .jpg, else the script will  fail (to be fixed...)

Based on this input, script will look for 2Nxxxxxxxxx**XYZ**xxxxP1981xxxx.img for 3d data and 2Nxxxxxxxxx**EFF**xxxxP1981xxxx.jpg or 2Nxxxxxxxxx**FFL**xxxxP1981xxxx.jpg for texture.

## Batch processing

To automate the processing of multiple files, just input them as a comma separated sequence in the input box

## Installation
Download the python script (v2 for Blender 2.80+) and install as addon in Blender’s Preference panel. Enable it.
Select the addon from the Import Menu (File > Import) or from the Misc tab in the Tools menu.

## How does it work?
Start the addon and enter or paste the name of a Left Navcam image  in the popup dialog and press OK. The addon will automatically download the corresponding depth and image products from the NASA/PDS image archive and stitch the data together into a single UV textured mesh. It will then add a caption and a camera so Blender can render the scene immediately.
  
Note that this process takes a while and Blender is unresponsive during execution. The status of the addon can be checked in the terminal window, **which must be enabled before starting script.**

The resulting mesh, which is in no way scientifically accurate, can contain over a million vertices and will have gaps and glitches. For artistic purposes this addon provides an option to fill small gaps.

Check this [page](https://github.com/phaseIV/Blender-Navcam-Importer/wiki/Instructions) for information about obtaining Navcam image names.

## UPDATES
17 Apr 2016: The addon is upgraded with an option to use 16bit RAD images for texturing the mesh.  
14 Jan 2019: Rewrote parts to make the addon compatible with Blender 2.8.
July 2022 (Jumpjack): Added support for SPIRIT/OPPORTUNITY pancam and hazcams

## Notes
The addon caches all downloaded data in Blender’s Temp directory. Texture images will get packed in the Blend file.

Batch import works by pasting a single line with comma seperated image names into the addon popupmenu.

## Color images
Mars Rover Navcam images are grayscale only. Projecting color images might get implemented in the future.

Pancam images are in greyscale, but being taken using different filter, it is possibile to "compose" them to get a "false colors" image, as described here: http://pancam.sese.asu.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_5.html :

>  the most common filter combination is L2, L5 and L7, which correspond to wavelengths of 753, 535, and 432 nm, respectively. When these are not available, the filter with the shortest wavelength available is used for the blue channel, the longest available wavelength is used for the red channel, and the median wavelength is used for the green value.

Filters and wavelengths (nm):
- **L2	753** -  Longest (Red)
- L3	673
- L4	601
- **L5	535** - Median (green)
- L6	482
- **L7	432** - Shortest (Blue)


Recent Navcam image ID’s don’t work because the depth images are not yet available in PDS.
